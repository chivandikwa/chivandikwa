I’m an software developer, husband, dad and tea lover. I currently work as a Senior Software Engineer in The Netherlands 🌷. 

- 📱  I’m currently working a lot in Python and .NET Core with Docker and K8s.
- 🤓 I’m currently learning F# and it may just lead to Haskell.
- 💚 I enjoy home automation. I use Zigbee devices, [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/core), [Conbee II](https://phoscon.de/en/conbee2/) and [Node Red](https://github.com/node-red/node-red). 
- 💬  Ask me about Functional Programming, Python and.NET Core.

- 🚴🏽‍♀️  Fun fact: I love taking photographs of pretty much anything but mainly I do nature and archticture and senseless roadtrips!
